<P>The heavy rains in Durban have left the streets of Umlazi Township filled with water. There will definitely be no commuting until the rain stops. <i>Intendele ayiwanga esokeni</i>, says a local commmunity member. This is a catastrophic event of nature that will grow exponetially the rate of poverty to those who had little, now they have nothing as informal settlements have been swept to the gorund by the floods.</P>
<P>The department of social awareness has gathered it task force to relief the stress of the tradedy by proving camps for those who lost their homes, nevertheless they need extra support they can get. Any sort of support for our mothers,brothers,sisters and children they need reach out to them and give them a hand of good hope in IsiZulu they say, <i>Izandla ziyagezana,</i> which means humans are human for their humanity. Local authories have tried to the best of their ability to evacuate people into the safety camp where they will be provided with shelter,clothing and food.</P>
<P>As we all know these kind of support from the government aren't sustainable so any sponsorship is welcome and as well as volunteery work to help with the tradedy.</P>
